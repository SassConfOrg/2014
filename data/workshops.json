      "session_description": "<p>Whether you’ve been using Sass for a while or are still trying to figure out how to abandon plain CSS, refactoring a large project can be a daunting task. We all know it’s too hard to refactor everything for months and launch it all at once, so how do you begin a multi-step refactoring process?</p> <h4>What you'll learn</h4> <p>In this four-hour workshop, Jina and Elyse will walk you through the basics of refactoring using Sass. You’ll receive guidelines for how to refactor for clarity, maintainability, efficiency, and DRY code, and learn how to test your changes. They’ll cover ways to break down a refactor into manageable chunks, help you understand how to modularize your CSS, and organize messy code into documented, style-guide ready files. Everyone will leave with a customized game plan of steps, tools, and guidelines to refactor their project—not a sample app—so bring your project code with you.</p> <h4>What This Workshop Will Cover</h4> <ul> <li>overview of ways to use Sass (CodeKit, Rails, libsass, nodesass, etc.)</li> <li>creating color and typography variables</li> <li>breaking out and importing files</li> <li>determining CSS/UI modules, where they live in your app, and how to organize them</li> <li>namespacing for style safety</li> <li>commenting and in-CSS documentation</li> <li>creating living style guides</li> <li>naming conventions and refactoring classes/IDs</li> <li>testing for changes</li> </ul><h4>Requirements</h4> <p>Bring your laptop with your personal codebase you want to refactor. If you don’t have a project in mind, that’s fine; you can still get a lot out of it. We’re hoping to have people come up with a game plan for their own projects that need refactoring, rather than a sample project.</p>"
